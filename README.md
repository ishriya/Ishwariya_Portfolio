# Project 1: Simple Linear Regression to predict the price of a house

* Created a model to predict the sales price of a house based on total square feet
* The dataset is obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
* Peprocessed the data and performed exploratory data analysis to find the infuencing variables

* Linear regression did not perform the best
* Acheived an explained variance score (EVS) of less than 60%
